# Problem Statement: 
In the current global scenario we are seeing a lot of protests with huge gathering happening on various issues. Surveillance in such cases is a major challenge for the authorities. It is easy for anti social elements to masquerade as protestors and create unrest. SurvOnTheGo is a real time surveillance system which enables detection of knives, guns and other dangerous objects and alert authorities to take requisite steps. 

# Challenges: 
* Making the system work accurately in a large gathering is a major challenge. 
* In such settings a lot of occlusion happens and accurate delineation of the boundaries is difficult.
* Currently used surveillance systems are not yet fully automatic which Requires human effort to properly analyze CCTV footage and other surveillance feeds which make this process time-consuming.
* The proposed method can be used to detect such issues and send alert to nearest police station or security force. This way, we can make CCTV more intelligent and smart.
